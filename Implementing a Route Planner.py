# ### Map Basics

# In[10]:


map_10 = load_map_10()
show_map(map_10)


# The map above (run the code cell if you don't see it) shows a disconnected network of 10 intersections. The two intersections on the left are connected to each other but they are not connected to the rest of the road network. This map is quite literal in its expression of distance and connectivity. On the graph above, the edge between 2 nodes(intersections) represents a literal straight road not just an abstract connection of 2 cities.
# 
# These `Map` objects have two properties you will want to use to implement A\* search: `intersections` and `roads`
# 
# **Intersections**
# 
# The `intersections` are represented as a dictionary. 
# 
# In this example, there are 10 intersections, each identified by an x,y coordinate. The coordinates are listed below. You can hover over each dot in the map above to see the intersection number.

# In[11]:


map_10.intersections


# **Roads**
# 
# The `roads` property is a list where `roads[i]` contains a list of the intersections that intersection `i` connects to.

# In[12]:


# this shows that intersection 0 connects to intersections 7, 6, and 5
map_10.roads[0] 


# In[13]:


# This shows the full connectivity of the map
map_10.roads


# In[14]:


# map_40 is a bigger map than map_10
map_40 = load_map_40()
show_map(map_40)


# ### Advanced Visualizations
# 
# The map above shows a network of roads which spans 40 different intersections (labeled 0 through 39). 
# 
# The `show_map` function which generated this map also takes a few optional parameters which might be useful for visualizing the output of the search algorithm you will write.
# 
# * `start` - The "start" node for the search algorithm.
# * `goal`  - The "goal" node.
# * `path`  - An array of integers which corresponds to a valid sequence of intersection visits on the map.

# In[15]:


# run this code, note the effect of including the optional
# parameters in the function call.
show_map(map_40, start=5, goal=34, path=[5,16,37,12,34])


# ## The Algorithm
# ### Writing your algorithm
# The algorithm written will be responsible for generating a `path` like the one passed into `show_map` above. In fact, when called with the same map, start and goal, as above you algorithm should produce the path `[5, 16, 37, 12, 34]`. However you must complete several methods before it will work.
# 
# ```bash
# > PathPlanner(map_40, 5, 34).path
# [5, 16, 37, 12, 34]
# ```

# ### PathPlanner class
# 
# The below class is already partly implemented for you - you will implement additional functions that will also get included within this class further below.
# 
# Let's very briefly walk through each part below.
# 
# `__init__` - We initialize our path planner with a map, M, and typically a start and goal node. If either of these are `None`, the rest of the variables here are also set to none. If you don't have both a start and a goal, there's no path to plan! The rest of these variables come from functions you will soon implement. 
# - `closedSet` includes any explored/visited nodes. 
# - `openSet` are any nodes on our frontier for potential future exploration. 
# - `cameFrom` will hold the previous node that best reaches a given node
# - `gScore` is the `g` in our `f = g + h` equation, or the actual cost to reach our current node
# - `fScore` is the combination of `g` and `h`, i.e. the `gScore` plus a heuristic; total cost to reach the goal
# - `path` comes from the `run_search` function, which is already built for you.
# 
# `reconstruct_path` - This function just rebuilds the path after search is run, going from the goal node backwards using each node's `cameFrom` information.
# 
# `_reset` - Resets *most* of our initialized variables for PathPlanner. This *does not* reset the map, start or goal variables, for reasons which you may notice later, depending on your implementation.
# 
# `run_search` - This does a lot of the legwork to run search once you've implemented everything else below. First, it checks whether the map, goal and start have been added to the class. Then, it will also check if the other variables, other than `path` are initialized (note that these are only needed to be re-run if the goal or start were not originally given when initializing the class, based on what we discussed above for `__init__`.
# 
# From here, we use a function you will implement, `is_open_empty`, to check that there are still nodes to explore (you'll need to make sure to feed `openSet` the start node to make sure the algorithm doesn't immediately think there is nothing to open!). If we're at our goal, we reconstruct the path. If not, we move our current node from the frontier (`openSet`) and into explored (`closedSet`). Then, we check out the neighbors of the current node, check out their costs, and plan our next move.
# 
# This is the main idea behind A*, but none of it is going to work until you implement all the relevant parts, which will be included below after the class code.

# If the code below produces no errors, your algorithm is behaving correctly. You are almost ready to submit! Before you submit, go through the following submission checklist:
# 
# **Submission Checklist**
# 
# 1. Does my code pass all tests?
# 2. Does my code implement `A*` search and not some other search algorithm?
# 3. Do I use an **admissible heuristic** to direct search efforts towards the goal?
# 4. Do I use data structures which avoid unnecessarily slow lookups?
# 
# When you can answer "yes" to all of these questions, and also have answered the written questions below, submit by pressing the Submit button in the lower right!
